# RysCocoa_PracticeSampleCode_Swift
This repository is my Mac programming practice with Ry's Cocoa Tutorial ebook. I put my exercises in this repository for backup. The original tutorials in this book were written in Objective-C but I use Swift to re-write it. This makes me to practice Swift as well.
